My name is <b>Offsec Dan</b> and I'm just an ethical hacking and offensive security enthusiast. If it involves attacking systems, bypassing security defenses or escalating privileges, I'm all about it. A massive fan of [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/user/54487) and [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/132632), I'm just looking to learn, hack and give back.

My goal is to continually learn and work to master my craft, and these posts are an attempt to share things I've learned along the way. I hope you can get something out of them and learn from my mistakes.
