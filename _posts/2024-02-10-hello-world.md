Every blog needs a first post, and I can think of no better title than `Hello, World!`. 

For those unfamiliar with the phrase, it's typically the first program one writes when learning a new programming language (see [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/blog/the-history-of-hello-world/) for a detailed history). While not strictly applicable to writing a blog post, it's close enough.

So, an introduction is probably warranted. In essence, I'm just your friendly neighbourhood hacking enthusiast. Having been introduced to [CTFs](https://ctftime.org/user/54487) and [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/132632) several years ago, I quickly fell in love with learning how to attack systems and bypass security measures. I've worked in a few different IT fields in the past, but for all that experience and despite my passion, I've never felt like I could take that next step towards a career as an ethical hacker. For reasons I may never truly appreciate, that changed in earnest roughly 6 months ago, and since then I've been fully committed to making it happen.

My plan with this blog then, is to document my journey into the diverse and wonderful world of offensive security. I find that publishing experiences and writeups forces me to distill my understanding of the concepts involved, reinforcing the things I've learned. With any luck, these posts can also help other people who are on a similar journey.
